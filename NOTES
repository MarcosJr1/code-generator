The CLI have to Generate code so for that we need:
  - Read user Input
  - Understand User Input
  - Generate the code
  - Output code generated into Files

So we have:
  - The Entry point that are the command with a Run function
  - The EJS template to generate code on top of

So the archtecture would be:
  - The entry point: commands/generate (melhorar nome)
  - Run function that must be separated from the command: runners/generate
  - The mechanism/logic piece where do you call the generator: logic/generate
  - The managers functions used to manage the files that must be separated from the runners: managers/generate
